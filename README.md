# Nadi
Nadi (meaning "pulse" or "vibration" in Sanskrit) is an IoT-powered smartwatch designed to bridge the gap between traditional health monitoring and modern wearable technology. Developed as a final year project for my B.Tech in Computer Science (IoT Specialization), this wearable focuses on real-time data acquisition and seamless cloud integration.
